A minimal telehash seed
=======================

Just run `node seed.js` to start it, and it will give you a JSON entry of it's information.  

To be a seed you need a well-known / accessible IP address and port, so it tries to guess your network address and use that by default.  To manually set either use `--ip 1.2.3.4 --port 5678`.

You can also do a `-v` to see debug output.
